## Submission Procedure

1. Fork this repository.
2. Open this [Google Colaboratory Notebook](https://www.nwcg.gov/publications/pms437/cffdrs/fire-weather-index-system), & copy it to your google drive(**recommended**) or alternatively, use the provided Sample_Submission.ipynb Jupyter Notebook inside the template folder if you want to modify the submission locally on your machine. Create your own model and fill in the missing blanks in the functions provided there.
3. When you are finished updating the functions, convert your Notebook into a Python Script as you have to upload both of these under the submissions folder.
4. Add your files inside the submissions folder on your github repository. Make sure to include the both the .py and the .ipynb files in the following format : `Accuracy(rounded off to two digits)_YourClassifierName_YourName`, {For example : `68.23_DecisionTreeClassifier_Farhan`}. If needed you can also create a requirements file containing all dependencies/modules with versions in the requirements directory under submissions with the same name format as above.
